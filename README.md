## User Stories

1. As a bachelor, I want a quick and easy resource for cocktail recipes that will complement my stand-by liquors, so that I can entertain lady friends at a moment's notice without needing to run to the store for expensive mixers.

2. As a bartender just starting out, I want a way to funnel my guests into categories based on their needs and the atmosphere of the group they are with, so that I can provide an excellently catered experience.

3. As a party host who is unfamiliar with cocktails I want to be able to fuel the kind of atmosphere I desire in my party with the cocktails served. I wish to do this so I can learn more about cocktails and throw a great party.

4. As a disabled veteran, I want to be able to save time coming up with the right cocktail for movie night with my wife, so that I can fully realize the relaxation time I have.

5. As an over-the-hill career mechanic, I want access to some novel drink ideas so that I can wind down without the monotony of drinking lite beer all night.
